# Block2Project
Block 2 Project for CS3090 University of Utah

This program checks the strength of an inputted password. It checks the password's length and ensures it contains 
a special character, number, and uppercase letter. If it doesn't contain any one of the aspects of a 'strong'
password, it will notify you of how to improve on your password.

To run the program, simply download and open 'PasswordChecker.java' in an IDE of your choice, run the program, and 
input a password into the terminal of the IDE. This program doesn't require any dependencies.

This program is a simple tool made for CS3090 at the University of Utah, and is meant for educational purposes only.
It should NOT be used for securing your sensitive information.

If you are looking to ensure the security of your passwords, or generate strong passwords, there are many professionally
developed tools available that would be better suited to your needs. However, use your own personal judgement when
determining whether your password is secure enough.
